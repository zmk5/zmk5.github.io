Hi, I'm Zahi Kakish, a Senior Researcher at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). My interests include multi-robot systems, autonomous inspection in unconstrained and dynamic environments, and swarm robotics. I received my Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering from [Arizona State Unviersity](https://www.asu.edu/) under [Dr. Spring Berman](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/acs/person/spring-berman).


I am also a co-founder of the robotics company [Sol Robotics](https://www.solrobotics.com/) developing novel parallel actuated robots for large work environments.


Please reach out if you would like to collaborate or discuss robotics!
